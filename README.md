# Project Hub [In Progress]

Project Hub is a website to support a theoretical community center.

## Background
This project started from realizing that I rarely use many of my possessions anymore (such as board games and a pizza stone), and I really wouldn't mind if I lended it out. This got me thinking about how my community could be helping out each other more and potentially reduce waste. I felt a community center would be an appropriate medium to carry out these ideas; ideas such as volunteered workshops/classes, common interests meetings (such as knitting club), community potlucks, public computer lab, and the aforementioned shared goods library. It would be a place for community members to connect, share, and learn.


## Features [In progress]
The website to support this community would feature:
* An about page for guests to learn more about the community center
* A calendar for the center's official events and for community-member hosted events.
* An announcements page where community members can share information with the community
* A library system with ability for community members to add their items and for designated librarians to check out items to community members.
